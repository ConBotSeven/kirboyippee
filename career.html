	<h2><strong>Accomplishments</strong></h2>
	<p><strong>Kirby has destroyed many gods and world ending threats, such as Zero and Void Termina. He has gone to alternate worlds as well to destroy world ending threats such as Dark Mind and Fecto Elfilis, just to help the people of said world.</strong></p>
	
    <h2><strong>Contributions<strong></h2>
    <p>Kirby has also made many former villains into better people, such as King Dedede going from a horrible leader only caring about food to someone who is willing to sacrifice is life for just one singular waddle dee. Kirby has also made former villains such as Gooey into good friends just by helping them after he defeats them in combat.</p>

	<h2><strong>Kirby's Challenges</strong></h2>
    <p>Some of Kirby's challenges (besides challeging many gods) are taken in the form of him losing his main powers of to inhale objects and copy abilities. In a few games such as Kirby's Epic Yarn, he does overcome these challenges by figuring out how to use his new form to his ability. He always will find a way to overcome challenges and save the world.</p>
