	<h2><strong>Where Did Kirby Come From?<strong></h2>
	<p>Kirby's true origins are unknown, but it sometimes is stated that Void, who is the God of the Kirby universe, created him after coming across a lot of positive emotions. He just showed up on Popstar one day and he's lived there ever since.</p>
	
	<h2><strong>Kirby's Friends and Family(?) </strong></h2>
	<p>Kirby has a few friends such as Bandana Waddle Dee, King Dedede, and Meta Knight, who typically only challenge Kirby when they're under the influence of evil or just for a friendly battle. They have all been with him since the beginning. There are more friends of his, but what about family? The only real "family" Kirby has would probably be his alternate forms when he is split up by Dark Meta Knight in Kirby and the Amazing Mirror, and possibly Keeby, although it is up for debate.</p>
	
	<h2><strong>Kirby's Early Influences</strong></h2>
    <p>Kirby didn't really have any early influences, he just showed up one day and stopped King Dedede from eating all the food in Dream Land. He did have a little help saving the world from other people though prior to doing it fully himself.</p>
